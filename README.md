ODPSearch
=========

This code is here primarily as historical reference. There are many newer and better ways to index and search a few gigabytes of data. This was the state of the Open Directory Project's (http://dmoz.org/)search engine in 2002.

I had thought this code was lost, but I found a old tarball and knew it had to be kept safe. So here it is. If you're interested check out the README.txt for the original build and installation instructions.
